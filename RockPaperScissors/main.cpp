//Few honest words from programmer
//Client side may get packet extraction errors in every 3-4 turns.
//I assume it is because of we are trying client to connect and server to listen in each turn which is obviously very bad example
//You can seperate the code below into Server And Client classes and get rid of that error.However i wanted to keep them under same roof
//Since it is very useful to learn for beginners
